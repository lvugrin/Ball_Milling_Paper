# Ball_Milling_Paper

## Description
This project includes MATLAB scripts and raw data used for analysis for the paper titled: **Molecular Dynamics Modelling of Mechanical Activation and Catalysis by Liquid Additives in Ball-Milling Mechanochemistry**. There are two folders, **"Folder_1"** and **"Folder_2"**, each containing one Python script with the same name in `.py` format.

- **Script_1.py** was developed for analyzing specific data, tracking certain entities or processes during simulations. This script allows [describe the functionality of the script].
  
- **Script_2.py** is used for counting and analyzing complexes formed using the [name of the used package or library]. A complex is identified when [describe the criteria or methods for identification].
