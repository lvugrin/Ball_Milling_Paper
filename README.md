# Ball_Milling_Paper-Experimental part

## Description
This project includes MATLAB scripts, data used for powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for the paper titled: **Molecular Dynamics Modelling of Mechanical Activation and Catalysis by Liquid Additives in Ball-Milling Mechanochemistry**. There are four folders, **"FTIR data"**, **"PXRD data"**, **"Raman data"** and **"MATLAB scripts"**, each containing files in `.ASC`, `.m` or `.xy` format. Figures are made in MATLAB software and are depicted in in `.fig` or in `.png` format.

- **2d Time-Resolved Raman plot.m** was developed for analyzing Raman data collected in a real time. This script allow plotting of two-dimensional Raman plot for detecting changes in vibration Raman bands during time.

- **Least Square Analysis method.m** was used for deeper analysis of Raman spectra and .

- **Jar_substracting.m** was developed for editing the raw data by better substraction of the milling vessel and removing its contribution from. 

- **FTIR plot.m** and **PXRD plot.m** is used for analyzing and plotting FTIR spectra and diffractograms using the raw data.
